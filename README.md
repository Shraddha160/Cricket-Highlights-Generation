# Cricket-Highlights-Generation


## 🏏 Automated Cricket Highlights Generator using OCR + ML

This project is a smart cricket highlights generation system that uses **OCR (Tesseract)**, **Machine Learning (SVM, ANN, RF)**, and **video processing** techniques to automatically detect and extract key moments (like SIX, FOUR, WICKET) from cricket match videos.

🚀 **Key Features:**

* 🔍 Optical Character Recognition on scoreboard regions
* 🧠 Event classification using hybrid ML models (SVM, ANN, Random Forest)
* 🏷️ Event tagging (SIX, FOUR, WICKET, PLAYER, etc.)
* 🎞️ Highlight video generation from key timestamps
* 📊 Performance metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Accuracy
* 🌐 Web interface with Flask and Chart.js for analysis and UI

🧪 **Technologies Used:**
`Python`, `OpenCV`, `Tesseract OCR`, `Flask`, `Scikit-learn`, `MoviePy`, `YT-DLP`, `Chart.js`
